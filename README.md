In today's world, securing user credentials is of paramount importance. A key aspect of
any secure system is its ability to properly authenticate users while ensuring their
sensitive information, such as passwords, is kept secure. This project aims to build a
simple login system where users can register and log in securely. The system hashes
passwords before storing them in a MySQL database, making it resistant to unauthorized
access even in the event of a data breach.
